# codingChallenge

This coding challenge was completed using Python on the Flask framework. To encapsulate the entire conda environment that I am using, the following command can be used with the requirements.txt provided:

$ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>

Using this command will create an environment that contains all packages used (and many not used) in the project.

After running the command, the environment will be ready to run the program.
